# A Simple Text Spam Script
## How it works
The script asks you the text that you want to spam, and the number of times you want it to spam.
Then it waits 10 seconds, in which time you should highlight the input box to spam. 
It simulates typing the message, pressing enter, then waiting 0.1 seconds so that the inputs actually go through. It's just a dumb script I wrote for a friend

## How to use it
Clone this repo, then
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
and then run `spammer.py`

## Disclaimer
This script was not made to be used for malicious purposes, it is just a fun little script to troll your friends. I will not be held responsible for any malicious purposes this script is used for.
